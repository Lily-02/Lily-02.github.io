        <h3> 1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <section>
            <p> My first attention to this website was the background music and clickable effects in different frames.  </p>    
        </section>
        <h3> 2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
        
     <section>
        <ul>
           
            <li>
                 Get the headphone and lower soundtrack.</li>
            <li> Browse all the website interfaces. </li>
            <li> Interact with multiple frames. </li>
            <li> Click on every visible clickable buttons as author's name and an X mark. </li>
            <li> Choose another websites to browse when opening an X mark.</li>
            <li> Pause the text animation. </li>
            <li> Focus on the words to read the poems.</li>
            <li>Note specific words and figure out the main content in different frames.</li>
            <li>Combine the names from each topic to make a sentense.</li>
            <li>Search for Ocean Vuong.</li>
            
        </ul>
    </section>
        <h3>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <section>
        <p> I mostly participate in playing and pausing the words to understand the specific perfomances.</p>
    </section>
        <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    
       <section> <p> My prominent activity is scrolling serveral frames and reading the content. I pressed all interactive buttons to explore the web navigation.</p> </section>
        <h3> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </h3>
        <section><p>I believe that the author intends to present the romantic rhythm in an impressive style. This is because he used the swing tone of background music collaborating with the main headings in each frames ''Love, Flowers,..''   </p></section>
        <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal? </h3>

       <section> <p> My first thought about this website was matching games which requires users concentration when the cards automatically turn back like the way transition of text animation effects in these frames. This automaticity reminds me to the liberation from strict rules in poetic art. For example, when I suddenly pause each frame, they will be a range of different sentenses on the screen.</p> </section>
        <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) </h3>
        <section><p> It was a long period of time to reach the contents. Because of the text animation style, I used 4 minutes to skim, take note and read of each frame. It is totally 30 minutes to complete all 7 frames centering around the romantic topic. Therefore, I think that most visitors will not spend over 15 minutes for the experience.   </p></section>

        <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? </h3>
        <section><p> Even though there is a variety of words in every frames to explore, the total is around 7 sentenses. It enables to create more when mixing every words in different frames but it seems not a meaningful content. Therefore, users easily feel frustrated and bored after 10 to 15 minutes. Additionally, the poems is not from reliable sources so it perfomes like a personal blog. That's why I do not think it will last with the time.</p> </section>

        <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <section><p> There are 3 elements that engage me in my previous experiences. Firstly, the color palette are green and yellow which relates to the ancient style of 35 trams in Melbourne. Secondly, the soundtrack reminds me to the style of Mario game which demonstrates the catchy and nostalgic tones and evokes the feeling of 80s vibes. Lastly, the text animation recalls me to the matching games as I mentioned before.</p></section>

        <h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <section><p> The wesbite has the same flow with matching games. If users need to quickly flip the cards to collect information and match pictures in matching games, they can automatically play and pause mutiple frames to memorize and generate the main contents in this website.Another similar platform I think it matches to these frames is flash card. Users hold the screen to read words as flipping every words on flash card to study. This is how I can get used with its visual structure and navigation after 2 minutes.  </p></section>

        <h3> 11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience? </h3>
        <section><p> The flash card and matching games evoke the sense of nostalgia for my childhood games. The soundtrack reminds me the vibes 80s of Mario games, combined with a color palette of the vintage tram 35 in Melbourne, and romantic titles like 'love, kissing, flower...', all create an ambience of ancient love</p></section>
        <h3>12. What is the most <em><strong>frustrating</strong></em> part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
       <section> <p> One of the frustrating part of my interactive experiment is its random word systems when pausing frames so it enables to keep the sentence I want.</p></section>
        <h3>13. What is the most <em><strong>satisfying</strong></em> part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
        <section><p> However, its random systems also being the most interesting part, it's able to produce creative and new styles of poems.</p></section>
